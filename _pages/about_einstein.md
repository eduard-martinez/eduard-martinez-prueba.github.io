Iâ€™m a professor at the Department of Economics at Universidad ICESI and Director of the Center for Research in Economics and Finance (CIENFI). My research focuses on development economics, big data, and machine learning, particularly in their applications to public policy.

I have extensive experience in consulting, public policy analysis, and data-driven decision-making, with a background in regulatory and financial supervision. My work bridges academia, policy, and applied data science, helping institutions leverage advanced analytics for strategic insights and decision-making.
